Nevertheless, well-principled statistical inference procedures are still lacking, and most practitioners adopt methods from transcriptomics. These, however, cannot properly treat the principal complication of label-free proteomics, namely many non-randomly missing values.\nWe present proDA, a method to perform statistical tests for differential abundance of proteins. It models missing values in an intensity-dependent probabilistic manner. proDA is based on linear models and thus suitable for complex experimental designs, and boosts statistical power for small sample sizes by using variance moderation. We show that the currently widely used methods based on ad hoc imputation schemes can report excessive false positives, and that proDA not only overcomes this serious issue but also offers high sensitivity. Thus, proDA fills a crucial gap in the toolbox of quantitative proteomics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahlmann-Eltze","given":"Constantin"},{"family":"Anders","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"ahlmann-eltzeProDAProbabilisticDropout2020","DOI":"10.1101/661496","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"buyukozkanRoxStatisticalModel2023","abstract":"High-dimensional omics datasets frequently contain missing data points, which typically occur due to concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) of the profiling platform. The presence of such missing values significantly limits downstream statistical analysis and result interpretation. Two common techniques to deal with this issue include the removal of samples with missing values and imputation approaches that substitute the missing measurements with reasonable estimates. Both approaches, however, suffer from various shortcomings and pitfalls. In this paper, we present “rox”, a novel statistical model for the analysis of omics data with missing values without the need for imputation. The model directly incorporates missing values as “low” concentrations into the calculation. We show the superiority of rox over common approaches on simulated data and on six metabolomics datasets. Fully leveraging the information contained in LOD-based missing values, rox provides a powerful tool for the statistical analysis of omics data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Buyukozkan","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Benedetti","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Krumsiek","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"buyukozkanRoxStatisticalModel2023","container-title":"Metabolites","DOI":"10.3390/metabo13010127","ISSN":"2218-1989","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"127","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"rox: A Statistical Model for Regression with Missing Values","title-short":"rox","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/1/127","volume":"13"},

Due to common development of drug resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, third-generation inhibitors, including osimertinib and rociletinib, have been developed. A model of EGFR-driven lung cancer and a method to develop tumors of distinct epigenetic states through 3D organotypic cultures are described here. It is discovered that activation of the EGFR T790M/L858R mutation in lung epithelial cells can drive lung cancers with alveolar or bronchiolar features, which can originate from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells or bronchioalveolar stem cells, but not basal cells or club cells of the trachea. It is also demonstrated that these clones are able to retain their epigenetic differences through passaging orthotopically in mice and crucially that they have distinct drug vulnerabilities.

For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of ManagementThe Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- Søren Højsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark \"Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp\" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages.

In large metabolite panels, measurement values are frequently missing and, if neglected or sub-optimally imputed, can cause biased study results. We provided a publicly available, user-friendly R script to streamline the imputation of missing endogenous, unannotated, and xenobiotic metabolites. We evaluated the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) analyses implemented in our script by simulations using measured metabolites data from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study (n = 599). We simulated missing values in four unique metabolites from different pathways with different correlation structures in three sample sizes (599, 150, 50) with three missing percentages (15%, 30%, 60%), and using two missing mechanisms (completely at random and not at random). Based on the simulations, we found that for MICE, larger sample size was the primary factor decreasing bias and error. For kNN, the primary factor reducing bias and error was the metabolite correlation with its predictor metabolites. MICE provided consistently higher performance measures particularly for larger datasets (n > 50). In conclusion, we presented an imputation workflow in a publicly available R script to impute untargeted metabolomics data. Our simulations provided insight into the effects of sample size, percentage missing, and correlation structure on the accuracy of the two imputation methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Faquih","given":"Tariq"},{"family":"Smeden","given":"Maarten","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Jiao"},{"family":"Cessie","given":"Saskia","non-dropping-particle":"le"},{"family":"Kastenmüller","given":"Gabi"},{"family":"Krumsiek","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Noordam","given":"Raymond"},{"family":"Heemst","given":"Diana","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Rosendaal","given":"Frits R."},{"family":"Hylckama Vlieg","given":"Astrid","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Willems van Dijk","given":"Ko"},{"family":"Mook-Kanamori","given":"Dennis O."}],"citation-key":"faquih_missingvalueworkflow_2020","container-title":"Metabolites","container-title-short":"Metabolites","DOI":"10.3390/metabo10120486","ISSN":"2218-1989","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"PMCID":"PMC7761057","PMID":"33256233","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A Workflow for Missing Values Imputation of Untargeted Metabolomics Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761057/","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"gierlinski_statisticalmodels_2015","abstract":"Motivation: High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard method to determine differential gene expression. Identifying differentially expressed genes crucially depends on estimates of read-count variability. These estimates are typically based on statistical models such as the negative binomial distribution, which is employed by the tools edgeR, DESeq and cuffdiff. Until now, the validity of these models has usually been tested on either low-replicate RNA-seq data or simulations.Results: A 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment in yeast was performed and data tested against theoretical models. The observed gene read counts were consistent with both log-normal and negative binomial distributions, while the mean-variance relation followed the line of constant dispersion parameter of ∼0.01. The high-replicate data also allowed for strict quality control and screening of ‘bad’ replicates, which can drastically affect the gene read-count distribution.Availability and implementation: RNA-seq data have been submitted to ENA archive with project ID PRJEB5348.Contact:g.j.barton@dundee.ac.uk","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gierliński","given":"Marek"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Schofield","given":"Pietà"},{"family":"Schurch","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Sherstnev","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Vijender"},{"family":"Wrobel","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Gharbi","given":"Karim"},{"family":"Simpson","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Owen-Hughes","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Blaxter","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Barton","given":"Geoffrey J."}],"citation-key":"gierlinski_statisticalmodels_2015","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btv425","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,15]]},"page":"3625-3630","source":"Silverchair","title":"Statistical models for RNA-seq data derived from a two-condition 48-replicate experiment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv425","volume":"31"},

Recent works have surveyed the different statistical methods to conduct imputation and have compared them on real or simulated data sets and recommended a list of missing value imputation methods for proteomics application. Although insightful, these comparisons do not account for two important facts: (i) depending on the proteomics data set, the missingness mechanism may be of different natures and (ii) each imputation method is devoted to a specific type of missingness mechanism. As a result, we believe that the question at stake is not to find the most accurate imputation method in general but instead the most appropriate one. We describe a series of comparisons that support our views: For instance, we show that a supposedly “under-performing” method (i.e., giving baseline average results), if applied at the “appropriate” time in the data-processing pipeline (before or after peptide aggregation) on a data set with the “appropriate” nature of missing values, can outperform a blindly applied, supposedly “better-performing” method (i.e., the reference method from the state-of-the-art).

  {"id":"lemoine_gwenacoexpression_2021","abstract":"Background\nNetwork-based analysis of gene expression through co-expression networks can be used to investigate modular relationships occurring between genes performing different biological functions. An extended description of each of the network modules is therefore a critical step to understand the underlying processes contributing to a disease or a phenotype. Biological integration, topology study and conditions comparison (e.g. wild vs mutant) are the main methods to do so, but to date no tool combines them all into a single pipeline.\n\nResults\nHere we present GWENA, a new R package that integrates gene co-expression network construction and whole characterization of the detected modules through gene set enrichment, phenotypic association, hub genes detection, topological metric computation, and differential co-expression. To demonstrate its performance, we applied GWENA on two skeletal muscle datasets from young and old patients of GTEx study. Remarkably, we prioritized a gene whose involvement was unknown in the muscle development and growth. Moreover, new insights on the variations in patterns of co-expression were identified. The known phenomena of connectivity loss associated with aging was found coupled to a global reorganization of the relationships leading to expression of known aging related functions.\n\nConclusion\nGWENA is an R package available through Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GWENA.html) that has been developed to perform extended analysis of gene co-expression networks. Thanks to biological and topological information as well as differential co-expression, the package helps to dissect the role of genes relationships in diseases conditions or targeted phenotypes. GWENA goes beyond existing packages that perform co-expression analysis by including new tools to fully characterize modules, such as differential co-expression, additional enrichment databases, and network visualization.\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12859-021-04179-4.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemoine","given":"Gwenaëlle G."},{"family":"Scott-Boyer","given":"Marie-Pier"},{"family":"Ambroise","given":"Bathilde"},{"family":"Périn","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Droit","given":"Arnaud"}],"citation-key":"lemoine_gwenacoexpression_2021","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-021-04179-4","ISSN":"1471-2105","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"PMCID":"PMC8152313","PMID":"null","source":"PubMed Central","title":"GWENA: gene co-expression networks analysis and extended modules characterization in a single Bioconductor package","title-short":"GWENA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8152313/","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"liNeitherRandomCensored2023","abstract":"Mass spectrometry proteomics is a powerful tool in biomedical research but its usefulness is limited by the frequent occurrence of missing values in peptides that cannot be reliably quantified (detected) for particular samples. Many analysis strategies have been proposed for missing values where the discussion often focuses on distinguishing whether values are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR).Statistical models and algorithms are proposed for estimating the detection probabilities and for evaluating how much statistical information can or cannot be recovered from the missing value pattern. The probability that an intensity is detected is shown to be accurately modeled as a logit-linear function of the underlying intensity, showing that missing value process is intermediate between MAR and censoring. The detection probability asymptotes to 100% for high intensities, showing that missing values unrelated to intensity are rare. The rule applies globally to each dataset and is appropriate for both high and lowly expressed peptides. A probability model is developed that allows the distribution of unobserved intensities to be inferred from the observed values. The detection probability model is incorporated into a likelihood-based approach for assessing differential expression and successfully recovers statistical power compared to omitting the missing values from the analysis. In contrast, imputation methods are shown to perform poorly, either reducing statistical power or increasing the false discovery rate to unacceptable levels.Data and code to reproduce the results shown in this article are available from https://mengbo-li.github.io/protDP/.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Mengbo"},{"family":"Smyth","given":"Gordon K"}],"citation-key":"liNeitherRandomCensored2023","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btad200","ISSN":"1367-4811","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,1]]},"page":"btad200","source":"Silverchair","title":"Neither random nor censored: estimating intensity-dependent probabilities for missing values in label-free proteomics","title-short":"Neither random nor censored","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad200","volume":"39"},

Correlation and co-occurrence analysis revealed significant lipid profile differences between cancer and non-cancer samples. Further analysis of machine-learned lipid categories for the differentially abundant molecular formulas identified a high abundance sterol, high abundance and high m/z sphingolipid, and low abundance glycerophospholipid metabolic phenotype across the NSCLC samples. At the class level, higher abundances of sterol esters and lower abundances of cardiolipins were observed suggesting altered stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) or acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1) activity and altered human cardiolipin synthase 1 or lysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity respectively, the latter of which is known to confer apoptotic resistance.

  {"id":"moseleyErrorAnalysisPropagation2013","abstract":"Error analysis plays a fundamental role in describing the uncertainty in experimental results. It has several fundamental uses in metabolomics including experimental design, quality control of experiments, the selection of appropriate statistical methods, and the determination of uncertainty in results. Furthermore, the importance of error analysis has grown with the increasing number, complexity, and heterogeneity of measurements characteristic of ‘omics research. The increase in data complexity is particularly problematic for metabolomics, which has more heterogeneity than other omics technologies due to the much wider range of molecular entities detected and measured. This review introduces the fundamental concepts of error analysis as they apply to a wide range of metabolomics experimental designs and it discusses current methodologies for determining the propagation of uncertainty in appropriate metabolomics data analysis. These methodologies include analytical derivation and approximation techniques, Monte Carlo error analysis, and error analysis in metabolic inverse problems. Current limitations of each methodology with respect to metabolomics data analysis are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Moseley","given":"Hunter N.

Rats selectively bred for high running capacity (HCR) have improved metabolic health and are longer-lived than their low-capacity counterparts (LCR). Using metabolomic and proteomic profiling, we show that HCR efficiently oxidize fatty acids (FAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), sparing glycogen and reducing accumulation of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines. HCR mitochondria have reduced acetylation of mitochondrial proteins within oxidative pathways at rest, and there is rapid protein deacetylation with exercise, which is greater in HCR than LCR. Fluxomic analysis of valine degradation with exercise demonstrates a functional role of differential protein acetylation in HCR and LCR. Our data suggest that efficient FA and BCAA utilization contribute to high intrinsic exercise capacity and the health and longevity benefits associated with enhanced fitness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Overmyer","given":"Katherine A."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Charles R."},{"family":"Qi","given":"Nathan R."},{"family":"Minogue","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Carson","given":"Joshua J."},{"family":"Chermside-Scabbo","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Koch","given":"Lauren G."},{"family":"Britton","given":"Steven L."},{"family":"Pagliarini","given":"David J."},{"family":"Coon","given":"Joshua J."},{"family":"Burant","given":"Charles F."}],"citation-key":"overmyerMaximalOxidativeCapacity2015","container-title":"Cell Metabolism","container-title-short":"Cell Metabolism","DOI":"10.1016/j.cmet.2015.02.007","ISSN":"1550-4131","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"468-478","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Maximal Oxidative Capacity during Exercise Is Associated with Skeletal Muscle Fuel Selection and Dynamic Changes in Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115000595","volume":"21"},

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodgers","given":"Joseph Lee"},{"family":"Nicewander","given":"W.

Their use can be limited to simple exploratory analysis or to construct association networks for visualization but they are also basic ingredients for sophisticated multivariate data analysis methods. It is therefore important to have reliable estimates for correlation coefficients. In modern life sciences, comprehensive measurement techniques are used to measure metabolites, proteins, gene-expressions and other types of data. All these measurement techniques have errors. Whereas in the old days, with simple measurements, the errors were also simple, that is not the case anymore. Errors are heterogeneous, non-constant and not independent. This hampers the quality of the estimated correlation coefficients seriously. We will discuss the different types of errors as present in modern comprehensive life science data and show with theory, simulations and real-life data how these affect the correlation coefficients.

  {"id":"schurchHowManyBiological2016","abstract":"RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20%–40% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve >85% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools.

The missing values should be imputed before performing data mining, machine learning, and other data processing tasks. Ten correlation-based imputation methods are proposed in this paper. All of these methods try to maximize the correlation between a missing feature and other features. The maximization is achieved by selecting segments of data that have strong correlations. The proposed approach involves the following main steps to impute each missing instance. First, a base set is selected from complete instances. Second, data segments with strong correlations are generated using the base set and the rest of the complete instances. Finally, each missing value is imputed by applying linear models to the discovered segments of data. This study considers seven real datasets from different fields with different missing rates. The imputation quality of the proposed methods is compared to those of seven other imputation approaches in terms of three well-known evaluation criteria. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach has better imputation performance than competing imputation techniques in most cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sefidian","given":"Amir Masoud"},{"family":"Daneshpour","given":"Negin"}],"citation-key":"sefidianEstimatingMissingData2020","container-title":"Applied Soft Computing","container-title-short":"Applied Soft Computing","DOI":"10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106249","ISSN":"1568-4946","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"106249","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Estimating missing data using novel correlation maximization based methods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620301897","volume":"91"},

In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework.

Imputation has several drawbacks for which alternatives exist, but currently imputation is still a practical solution widely adopted in single-cell proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the advantages and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5 main challenges linked to missing value management in single-cell proteomics. Future developments should aim to solve these challenges, whether it is through imputation or data modelling.

In this paper we show how optimizing the Q function can be reformulated as a spectral relaxation problem and propose two new spectral clustering algorithms that seek to maximize Q. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithms are eﬃcient and eﬀective at ﬁnding both good clusterings and the appropriate number of clusters across a variety of real-world graph data sets.
